The hbs package, allows us to add partials into our code
 in a super simple way. First, we need to register the 
 partials. We need to call the registerPartials method 
 of the hbs package and send as a parameter where we will
  locate our partials. registerPartials provides a quick 
  way to load all partials from a specific directory.
